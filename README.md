# HOLY SHIT!
Can it be? Another mediocre clone of Litecoin? Take a good look bitch, for it is! This piece of shit is a shitty^2 clone of Litecoin v0.8.7.5. That's right, it's so shitty that I based it off of a version that was in use 4 years ago. It isn't even the first fucking cryptocurrency to use the name "Shitcoin," at least one of which had the damn decency to try and offer some weird technical gimmick. Not this one! Just a good ol' shitcoin.

## So how does one get this shit? 
I'll fucking show you:

### Windows
I hope you windows asshats are grateful because I slaved over getting the damned cross compiler to work. Oh, and one warning: windows defender is almost certainly going to bitch slap the program, so just be ready for that. The download comes with the source code, qt executable, installer, and daemon. Use the qt executable if you do not want a complete install.

### Linux
[Fucking compile it yourself](doc/build-unix.md)

### OS X 
You think that I would take the time to make a client for OS X? HA! Well the real reason is that this thing is so shitty that critical dependencies have reached EOL and I'd have to go through a masochistic bullshit quest in order to get a real mac client. If you'd like to try yourself, be my guest. However, if you are using OS X and will still like to be a part of this mistake, I've found that Shitcoin works well with [WineBottler](http://winebottler.kronenberg.org) (a nice utility to have regardless), which essentially creates a windows environment for a specific program. Just fire it up, point it at the windows installer and **WOOSH**, you're shitty.

## How do I use this fucking thing?
How hard can it be just run the damn program. The IP address of shitnode prime is hardcoded into the software, so a minute or so after starting the software you should be linked to the shitcoin network. If you connect and your client still says you're behind even though it stopped downloading blocks, odds are it's been some time since someone's mined shit. You can correct this yourself by mining a new block right then and there. If you're interested in mining, [see the documentation](doc/MINING.md). 

## How to become a true Shitcoiner

1. Take a shit whilst mining SHIT
2. Solo mine at least one block of SHIT from McDonalds guest wifi
3. Contribute enough hashing power to the network to single-handedly control difficulty (shouldn't be that hard lol)
4. Bonus points if you do the previous three all at the same time
5. Host a Shitcoin node (no really my Raspberry pi cannot be the sole conduit for Shitcoin traffic)

## Shitcoin fun facts:
- The current block reward is 10 SHIT with new blocks every ~3 minutes
- Who cares about maximum coin supply
- Shitcoin P2P port is 14301
- At one point, over half of the shitnet's hashing power was, indeed, coming from the guest wifi of a McDonalds in New York

As is tradition with cryptocurrency related projects (I use that word loosely), I will now dump BTC and LTC donation addresses in the event that I at least made you laugh and you have magic internet money to spare:

LTC: LT9WyFQFa1XRH5rYDc94ShfeJ2WYMVm6Hp

BTC: 1Jk1ZZLzxqA6XAtsNE41vwWh8LVPA6nRYG

Alternatively, if you wish to insult me, here is my designated shitting address:
